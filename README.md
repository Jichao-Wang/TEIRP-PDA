# TEIRP-PDA

## Introduction
TEIRP_PDA.py is the core part of the work. It includes implementation of the TEIRP_PDA and several experiments about TEIRP_PDA. The entry point to use TEIRP_PDA is the function two_aggregator() in TEIRP_PDA.py.

main.py, main.m, simulate_secondary_frequency.m, and untitled.slx are only used for the frequency simulation as the last part of the work.

# Environments
Softwares:
Matlab 2024a (with simulator)
Python 3.11.9
Gurobi 11.0.3

Some python packages:
gurobipy                  11.0.3
matlabengine              24.1
matplotlib                3.9.2
pandas                    2.2.2

## Quick start
Note: If you want simulate the frequency, please open Matlab before run python files.

python two_aggregator.py
